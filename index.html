    <h1>The misadventures of an AI </h1>
    <h2>By Raheem Freeman</h2>
    <p>This story takes place in New York, 2049, and it is narrated by a despondent robot. The robot, or AI, travels throughout the phones, computers, and laptops of random New Yorkers in search of his true purpose. I made this concept because I thought it would work well with the specific tools and modifications that photoshop supports, and it did.</p>
